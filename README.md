To run the program simply start the 'UESC Banking program.exe'.
The code used to make the program works by a command-line interface,
it wont understand natural language. So be sure to spell and type
correctly. Not doing so may cause the program to crash. In the event of
a crash, the program will need to be restarted. Unsaved data will be lost.
The .exe file and its accompanying files must be kept in the same folder
for the program to work.

In the event of repeated crashes or a bug, contact the author.
